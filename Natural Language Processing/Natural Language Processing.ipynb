      "[\"JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS\\n  The Ministry of International Trade and\\n  Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand\\n  outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese\\n  energy demand, ministry officials said.\\n      MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy\\n  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600\\n  mln, they said.\\n      The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in\\n  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen\\n  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.\\n      MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand\\n  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the\\n  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.\\n      They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy\\n  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.\\n      Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power\\n  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27\\n  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and\\n  liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.\\n  \\n\\n\", \"ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY\\n  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.\\n  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will\\n  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record\\n  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,\\n  major company executives predicted.\\n      This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an\\n  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF\\n  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms\\n  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.\\n      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the\\n  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for\\n  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.\\n      \\\"I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,\\\" said\\n  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,\\n  \\\"There's no major plant capacity being added around the world\\n  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving\\n  the old ones.\\\"\\n      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,\\n  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of\\n  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.\\n      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about\\n  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike\\n  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,\\n  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand\\n  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up\\n  by as much as 300 pct, he said.\\n      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in\\n  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned\\n  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its\\n  history.\\n      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel\\n  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.\\n  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. \\\"I believe the entire\\n  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,\\\"\\n  Oreffice said.\\n      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical\\n  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.\\n  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion\\n  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.\\n      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical\\n  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and\\n  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.\\n      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks\\n  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar\\n  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost\\n  U.S. chemical exports.\\n      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has\\n  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical\\n  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers\\n  in the early 1980s.\\n      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers\\n  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program\\n  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate\\n  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of\\n  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.\\n      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire\\n  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs\\n  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics\\n  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> \\n  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer\\n  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.\\n      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be\\n  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on\\n  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as\\n  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that\\n  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.\\n      \\\"Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the\\n  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity\\n  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had\\n  deteriorated,\\\" Dosher said. \\\"But I think they will eventually\\n  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche\\n  market.\\\" Some top chemical executives share the concern.\\n      \\\"The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting\\n  carried away and repeating past mistakes,\\\" GAF's Heyman\\n  cautioned. \\\"The shift from commodity chemicals may be\\n  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.\\\"\\n      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the\\n  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700\\n  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.\\n      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout\\n  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1\\n  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants\\n  along the Texas Gulf Coast.\\n      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that\\n  are the building blocks of specialty products.\\n      \\\"This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a\\n  glamorous, high-margin business,\\\" Cain said, adding that demand\\n  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.\\n      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said\\n  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for\\n  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood\\n  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical\\n  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the\\n  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.\\n  \\n\\n\", \"TURKEY CALLS FOR DIALOGUE TO SOLVE DISPUTE\\n  Turkey said today its disputes with\\n  Greece, including rights on the continental shelf in the Aegean\\n  Sea, should be solved through negotiations.\\n      A Foreign Ministry statement said the latest crisis between\\n  the two NATO members stemmed from the continental shelf dispute\\n  and an agreement on this issue would effect the security,\\n  economy and other rights of both countries.\\n      \\\"As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be\\n  found by bilateral negotiations,\\\" the statement said. Greece has\\n  repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the\\n  International Court of Justice.\\n      The two countries approached armed confrontation last month\\n  after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the\\n  Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.\\n      A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to\\n  territorrial waters. \\\"The latest crises created an historic\\n  opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries,\\\"\\n  the Foreign Ministry statement said.\\n      Turkey's ambassador in Athens, Nazmi Akiman, was due to\\n  meet Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou today for the Greek\\n  reply to a message sent last week by Turkish Prime Minister\\n  Turgut Ozal.

At\\n  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed\\n  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference\\n  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985\\n  when members offered discounts to attract customers.\\n      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8\\n  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter\\n  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend\\n  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.\\n      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not\\n  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr\\n  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,\\n  analysts say.\\n      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one\\n  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export\\n  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.\\n  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.\\n      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil\\n  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say\\n  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at\\n  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing\\n  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.\\n      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,\\n  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to\\n  pay the new prices.\\n     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude\\n  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --\\n  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.\\n      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below\\n  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota.

That means new drilling programs must begin no later\\n  than mid-1988,\\\" Gaspar said.\\n      Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that\\n  could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count\\n  to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989.\\n      Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be\\n  conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where\\n  federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the\\n  government unless drilling begins in the next two or three\\n  years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon\\n  Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have\\n  already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later\\n  this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said.\\n      For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont &lt;DD> subsidiary, will\\n  spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest\\n  production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of\\n  gas per day.\\n      But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and\\n  Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership &lt;MLP> in\\n  recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is\\n  on the verge of a recovery.\\n      Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below\\n  600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do.\\n      \\\"The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets\\n  above 30 dlrs a barrel,\\\" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not\\n  expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime.\\n      Tenneco Inc &lt;TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers,\\n  is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists.\\n      Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect\\n  significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s\\n  when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about\\n  seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50\\n  dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three\\n  dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said.\\n  \\n\\n\", \"U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH\\n  The U.S. oil and gas industry is in\\n  better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony\\n  given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of\\n  the industry hearing today.\\n       The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas\\n  industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company\\n  executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry\\n  downturn had bottomed out.\\n       \\\"The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal\\n  more optimistic (than last year),\\\" Commissioner James E.

affecting\\n  Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum\\n  Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.\\n      Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is\\n  derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak\\n  crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.\\n      This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the\\n  country's economic performance directly by acting as a\\n  disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting\\n  trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.\\n      Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency\\n  position is posing a major economic threat, yet the\\n  government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the\\n  oil industry, Benbow said.\\n      Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to\\n  fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from\\n  546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the\\n  Bass Strait fields, he said.\\n      Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the\\n  three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.\\n      By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over\\n  half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped\\n  fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from\\n  existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.\\n      Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered\\n  fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.\\n      Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to\\n  680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a\\n  crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years\\n  time, he said.\\n      At present world oil prices and the current value of the\\n  Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost\\n  between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.\\n      Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the\\n  addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.\\n      For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five\\n  years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.\\n      He called on the

   \\\"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive\\n  at oil prices below 30 dlrs,\\\" Story said.\\n      Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher\\n  levels of

It was estimated that if\\n  oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that\\n  could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs.\\n      - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It\\n  would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000\\n  barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year.\\n      - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical\\n  expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a\\n  day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs.\\n      - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to\\n  spur exploration.
